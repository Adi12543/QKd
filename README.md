This is a network simulation in Java where nodes use Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to secure communications involving several steps. This simulation will require components for nodes, quantum key distribution protocols, communication channels, and evaluation metrics. 
Key Components
Node: Represents a participant in the network.
QKD Protocol: Implements the QKD protocol for secure key exchange.
Communication Channel: Simulates the communication between nodes.
Network Simulation: Manages nodes, channels, and simulates communication.
Evaluation Metrics: Measures performance, scalability, and security.
STEPS:
1. Set Up Development Environment
Programming Language: Java
2. Define Node Class
Nodes will represent participants in the network that can send and receive messages securely using QKD.
3. Implement QKD Protocol
For simplicity, weâ€™ll implement a basic version of the BB84 protocol.
4. Define Communication Channel
The communication channel will simulate the transmission of keys and messages between nodes.
5. Create Network Simulation
Manage nodes, channels, and simulate communication.
6. Evaluation Metrics
Implement evaluation metrics to assess performance, scalability, and resistance to attack vectors.
